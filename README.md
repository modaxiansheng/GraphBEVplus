## Overview

GraphBEV++ is a unified multi-modal feature alignment framework for robust
autonomous driving. It addresses the spatial and semantic misalignment between
camera and LiDAR BEV features caused by calibration noise, inaccurate
projection, and heterogeneous feature representations.

The framework combines two complementary components:

- **LocalAlign-v2** corrects local correspondence errors during BEV
  construction through neighborhood-aware graph matching.
- **GlobalAlign-v2** resolves accumulated representation-level inconsistencies
  during BEV fusion through deformable alignment or diffusion-based denoising.

GraphBEV++ supports both dense LSS-based and sparse query-based BEV
representations, and generalizes across 3D detection, tracking, prediction,
occupancy estimation, and end-to-end planning.

## Highlights

- **Unified alignment:** corrects misalignment at both BEV construction and
  feature fusion stages.
- **Cross-paradigm design:** supports LSS-based and query-based BEV
  representations.
- **Noise robustness:** retains strong detection performance under sensor
  calibration perturbations.
- **Task generalization:** improves perception, prediction, occupancy, and
  planning tasks.
- **Practical efficiency:** the LSS variant reaches 7.1 FPS on an NVIDIA A100
  with limited alignment overhead.

## Official Implementation

The training and evaluation code is maintained in the official
[GraphBEVplus repository](https://github.com/adept-thu/GraphBEVplus).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adept-thu/GraphBEVplus.git
cd GraphBEVplus
```

Follow the upstream guides to prepare the environment and nuScenes dataset:

- [Installation](./docs/INSTALL.md)
- [Dataset preparation](./docs/DATA_PREPARE.md)
- [Training and evaluation](./docs/TRAIN_EVAL.md)

Train the published query-based configuration on four GPUs:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 \
bash tools/dist_train.sh projects/configs/stage2_e2e/fusion_base_e2e.py 4
```

Evaluate a checkpoint:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 \
bash tools/dist_eval.sh projects/configs/stage2_e2e/fusion_base_e2e.py \
path/to/checkpoint.pth 4
```
